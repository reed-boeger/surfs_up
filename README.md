## Summary of Results
 ### Key Points
 - The mean temperature is around 2 and a half degrees warmer in June than December.
 - The standard deviation is higher in December than june, implying that the temperature is less consistant in December than June.
 - The minimum temperature in December is 6 degrees lower in December than June, and the max temperature in June is 4 degrees higher than in december again implying that the weather is more likely to be colder in december than june on any given day.
 - As an additional query we looked at the precipitation data for both months and it can be seen from the tables that the mean and max amount of precipitation is higher in December than January.

 ### Summary Statement
In summary, June is warmer, and December is wetter, so Hawaii is a little more mild and favorable of a place in the summer than the winter. However, the weather is still extremely warm in December and very desireable compared to the continental US.
